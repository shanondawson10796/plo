Funny / Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory One case has you trying to find Mr Navit in the real world. It's a person in a Mr Navit mascot. So i just finished both cyber sleuth and hackers memory, and have done everything in both games except for the abyss in hackers memory.  › watch.

 · Mr. Navit's Rescue Squad is a Bronze trophy in Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory (PS4 & Vita). It can be received for: Saved all broken Mr. Navits. Trophies. 21 rows ·  · Broken Mr. Navit Locations As you play through the game you will discover several broken Mr. Navit robots which must be repaired by using the Restoration Hacking Skill. You must have a Vaccine Digimon at the 73%(39). Mr. navit’s identity? Do we ever find out mr navit’s real identity? Because from what i understand from the clues, being female and a boss/high ranking figure at kamishiro, it seems like miss rie, but i cant imagine her being mr navit. Standing Still = Yuuko Air Guitar = Jimiken The perfume Navit = Ms. Rie.
