  This document attempts to make accessible to modern programmers the wonderful coding tricks invented at MIT in the late 60's/early 70's. MIT AI Memo , Feb. 29, Reverse the bits in a byte with 4 operations (bit multiply, no division). unsigned char b. ‚Äì by the MIT Lecturers. LECTURE 3 For example, the 8-bit word Ob1OO1O11O represents Because many bit hacks for words extend naturally.
  
  ¬†¬∑ Hacking at MIT has nothing to do with breaking into computer networks or computers. Instead hacking at MIT involves anonymous, ninja-like MIT students pulling off incredible feats of engineering right under the nose of the administration while quite possibly breaking dozens of laws and ending up on various rooftops around campus. ¬†¬∑ Bit Hacks for Simplicity: And with only two simple bit expressions, we have implemented a Data Structure called a BitSet. public class BitSet { private int [] bitset; public BitSet (int size) { bitset = new int [size / 32]; } public void Add (int index) { bitset [index / 32] |= (1 Estimated Reading Time: 8 mins.

Leiserson and Prof. Julian Shun Handout 4: Project 1: Bit Hacks Bit Hacks 6 it is easy to try something out and localize the bug, rather than spending hours trying to Ô¨Ågure out where it is, or worse, never realize that you have a bug in your code.
